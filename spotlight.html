            <p class="infotext spotlight">Since our founding in 1990, <b>video|action</b> has been collaborating with the leaders of innovative nonprofit endeavors to elevate the voices of people whose voices are rarely heard. Our spotlight today is on our work with Healing Justice, a national organization that serves individuals who have experienced trauma and inequity in our justice system. Through restorative justice and justice reform, Healing Justice provides post-trial support to crime victims, survivors and their families.</p>

            <h2 class="center">in Wrongful Conviction Cases</h2>
            
            <p class="infotext">The individuals whose voices are heard in these two videos were participants in a Healing Justice Retreat. They agreed to share their stories so we could create authentic accounts of what happens to victims and their families who, after years of thinking justice was served because the perpetrator was serving time, had their worlds upended when the conviction was overturned. The media coverage focuses heavily on the exoneree, and rightfully so, but the original victims are often left retraumatized in the shadows.</p>
            <p class="infotext">The individual testimonials we recorded are not for public distribution, but are available for peer-to-peer support on a website with Post-Conviction Survivor Resources. We were given permission to create two “multi-voice videos” with comments that provide a window into their experiences. As you can see, the videos are organized by crime – one features families of homicide victims and the other sexual assault survivors.</p>
            <p class="infotext">We are sharing these with you as a way to introduce the remarkable people who opened up their hearts for Healing Justice AND to feel the power of their storytelling.</p>

            <p class="infotext">On October 21, 2020, the American Pops Orchestra honored the work of Healing Justice with a Porch Concert - a socially-distanced, live musical event for 30 guests on the lawn of APO Maestro Luke Frazier. Two incredible singers, Tracy Lynn Olivera and Nova Payton dazzled us all, as did Thomas Webb, an exoneree who is part of the Healing Justice family, when he shared his deep appreciation for the support he has received.</p>
